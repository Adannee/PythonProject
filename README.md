 #Python Projects Collection  

This repository contains various **Python projects**, including **data analysis, machine learning, deep learning, and AI automation.**  

**Sales Data Analysis**  
ðŸ“Œ [Sales Data Analysis](sales-data-analysis/) - Analyzing sales trends, customer behavior, and business performance using Python & Pandas.  

 **Stock Market Analysis - Tesla (TSLA)**  
ðŸ“Œ [Stock Market Analysis](stock-market-analysis/) - Analyzing **Tesla (TSLA) stock trends, volatility, and future predictions** using **machine learning & technical indicators**.

 **Cafe Sales Data Cleaning - Pandas & Python**  
ðŸ“Œ [Cafe Sales Data Cleaning](cafe-sales-data-cleaning/) - Cleaning messy sales data by **handling missing values, removing duplicates, and standardizing formats** for accurate business insights.  

 **Customer Sales Data Cleaning - Pandas**  
ðŸ“Œ [Customer Sales Data Cleaning](customer-data-cleaning/) - Cleaning messy customer sales data by **handling missing values, removing duplicates, and standardizing formats** for accurate business insights. 

**Housing Price Prediction - Machine Learning & Linear Regression**  
ðŸ“Œ [Housing Price Prediction](House_Price_Prediction/) - predicts house prices using the Ames Housing Dataset. We apply Linear Regression with Feature Engineering to improve predictive accuracy.

**Customer Segmentation Analysis - Machine Learning & KMean Clustering** 
ðŸ“Œ [Customer_Segmentation](customer_segmentation/) - applies K-Means Clustering to segment customers based on their shopping behavior to identify distinct customer groups for better marketing strategies.

**Movie Recommendation System - Collaborative Filtering & Content-Based Filtering**  
ðŸ“Œ [Movie Recommendation System](MovieRecommendationSystem/) - A personalized movie recommendation system built using the MovieLens dataset and implemented with Collaborative Filtering and Content-Based Filtering techniques.

**Credit Card Fraud Detection - Machine Learning & Isolation Forest**  
ðŸ“Œ [Credit Card Fraud Detection](FraudDetection/) - This project implements a machine learning model to detect fraudulent credit card transactions using anomaly detection techniques like Isolation Forest. The goal is to accurately identify suspicious behavior in an imbalanced dataset.

**Tesla Stock Price Forecasting (Time Series) - ARIMA & LSTM**  
ðŸ“Œ [Tesla Stock Price Forecasting](TimeSeriesForecasting/) - This project uses two powerful time series forecasting models ARIMA and LSTM to predict Tesla stock prices based on historical data.
